# FFXIV Mount Finder

## Description

This simple React application utilizes the FFXIV API to view available mounts in game. The user can search for mounts by name, and organize by name or ID. Each mount is linked to their corresponding page on https://www.ffxivcollect.com for additional information. This was an exercise in React.
